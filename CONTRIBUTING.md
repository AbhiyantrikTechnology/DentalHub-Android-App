# CONTRIBUTING
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## How can I contribute

### Found a bug?
* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching  on GitHub under issues.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include
a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an
executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Have a patch for the bug?
* Please send a GitHub Pull Request to DentalHub-Android-App with a clear list of what you've done.

### Do you want to add a new feature or change existing one?
* Suggest your change in the [DentalHub](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dentalhub) mailing list and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### Do you have any other questions?
Ask any question about how to use DentalHub in the [DentalHub](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dentalhub) mailing list.
